## About the project <a name="about"></a>
This project is done as part of a Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course. The first project is mainly written in HTML and CSS, while making sure, it is responsive and works well across other devices with different screen sizes, such as phones, tablets, smaller screens, or larger screens. 

This project is created to showcase some of the fine art of a local business that provides barell saunas across the Ireland. This website shows just a small glimpse in what they are doing and what the goal is, and there is a lot potential to add all other information, work, etc. into this website in the future commits. 

### Target Audience <a name="audience"></a>

The target audience for this website would be people who are passionate about various ways to improve their health and are seeking for hassle free sauna installations, and where a low-maintenance needeed to keep running such saunas. Anyone, who is looking for that SPA in their own garden, that is budget friendly and easy to maintain.

## Design <a name="design"></a>
### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

Initially wireframes were done with pen and paper. 
Potentially for the future projects, I would be using Balsamiq to create any wireframes. 

- #### Main page <a name="main-page"></a>

The landing page of this website has a slideshow, that I used --webkit-animation to set timing and it is scrolling infinite and --webkit-keyframes to set slides scrolling.

The landing page has Menu bar at the top with transparent background that allows overflow the image full screen.

The logo was custom-made using canva.com. It was implemented as favicon for the website and can be seen on top of the page when website is open.

The landing page also has a footer on the bottom and a banner with text for the page.

- #### About page <a name="about-page"></a>

I have added sections to describe little more about why sauna is so good and have listed benefits of it, and an actual craftsman himself. 

Each section is highlighted in opposite colors, so it is more readable

What it is section

Story about the craftsman

Navigation bar was set to fixed, so it follows the page when scrolling down.

At the bottom there is a footer that has social media links added and Copyright section.
Both navigation and footer has been in bold dark color,  to make a contrast with rest of the page.

- #### Contact Us <a name="contact-us-page"></a>

Each form field is set to their types. Name for name. Email for email and Message for textarea.

### Color Scheme <a name="color-scheme"></a>

Color scheme was designed to set more natural look for the website. Brown and tan notes throughout the website. 
The color pallete was chosen from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).
![alt text](./images/color-palette.PNG "Color palette")

### Typography <a name="typography"></a>

For this project simple font style was chosen - Lato font downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

### Images <a name="images"></a>

All images in this project are taken from personal files. And logo has been created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com).

## Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"></a>
### Main Languages Used <a name="languages"></a>

HTML and CSS were main languages used for this project.

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>
### Compatibility Checks <a name="compatibility"></a>

Chrome Developer tools were used the most to see responsiveness of the website on different device sizes, and adjusting @media queries to fix bugs.

Checking each time when adding new styles or applying new changes.

Once the website was deployed, I did multiple checks across mobile phones and tablets. Unfortunately, I do not have any Apple products, and wasn't able to check those.

Also, it was checked across multiple brwsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox. No issues were found there.

### Validator Testing <a name="validator-testing"></a>

- The website was constantly tested during development using Chrome dev tools.
- All links, buttons and form required fields were tested.
- Website was tested in Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
- Extensive Mobile compatibilaty was checked through various devices: phones, tablets, medium and large screen devices. 

- HTML
    - An error was returned when first tested website through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Faigaa.github.io%2Fproject1%2Fthankyou.html)  
    ![alt text](./images/testing/html-testing-err.PNG "Error coming up as naming conventions were not followed for image files used in the project") 

    - These issues were fixed in the whole project, followed no errors (all pages has been tested)
    ![alt text](./images/testing/html-testing-no-err.PNG "No erros found")

- CSS
    - There were no errors found when testing through the official [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Faigaa.github.io%2Fproject1%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)  
    ![alt text](./images/testing/css-testing.PNG "No warnings displayed when ran through W3C CSS validator.")  

- Lighthouse 
    - Lighthouse was used to test the website for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO for desktop and mobile:
    - Home page:  
    ![alt text](./images/testing/lighthouse-med.PNG "Lighthouse test for home page")

    Very low on performance score here. This was slightly approved after adjusting image size, and current score is:

### Bugs <a name="bugs"></a>

Checking media queries, footer on contact page had to stick to the bottom. When checking all 
different screen sizes on Chrome Developer tool, it showed footer sticking in the middle, or overflowing
the content. I added @media query for smaller width size to set max-width of 375px position to unset, so this does not overflow the content. When Checking Nest Hub the footer was again overflowing the content. 
This thread was helpful to fix this [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11404744/css-media-queries-max-width-or-max-height) with option to add max-height to the existing media query, and this fixed my issue with the footer.
