# Barrel Saunas Ireland
This project is done as part of a Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course. The first project is mainly written in HTML and CSS, while making sure, it is responsive and works well across other devices with different screen sizes, such as phones, tablets, smaller screens, or larger screens. 

I decided to create this project as part for my brothers business. This website shows just a small glimpse in what he is doing and what his goal is, and there is a lot potential to add all other information, work, etc. into this website in the future commits. 

The landing page of this website has slideshow, that I used --webkit-animation to set timing and it is scrolling infinite and --webkit-keyframes to set slides scrolling correctly.

The landing page has Menu bar at the top with transparent background that allows overflow the image full screen.

The logo was custom-made using canva.com. It was implemented as favicon for the website and can be seen on top of the page when website is open.

## About page

I have added sections to describe little more about why sauna is so good and have listed benefits of it, and an actual craftsman himself. 

Each section is highlighted in opposite colors, so it is more readable

What it is section

Small story about the craftsman

Navigation bar was set to fixed, so it follows the page when scrolling down.

At the bottom there is a footer that has social media links added and Copyright section.
Both navigation and footer has been in bold dark color,  to make a contrast with rest of the page.
